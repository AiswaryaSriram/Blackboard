			As a handbook this guide is intended not just to help and inform, but also to provoke and
inspire. The contributors are professionals within their fields of expertise and apart from
being asked to cover the necessary topic have been free to deal with their subject how they
see fit – there has been no attempt to produce regulation and uniform chapters. The book
is aimed primarily at the student embarking on a creative writing programme in Higher
Education, with many of the writers here also teaching on creative writing MAs or MFAs,
and to that end many of the chapters reflect the different teaching styles on offer. This
book, therefore, is also intended for tutors. The aim throughout has been to have within
the pages of a single book all that you might need as a writer or tutor to further your writing
and teaching, and to further your writing career. It explores a number of different contexts
within which the student-writer and teacher of creative writing work: literary tradition and
genre, the postgraduate degree, the academy, literary culture, literary theory, the world of
publishing and production, the world of being a writer and writing.
How to read this book
I don’t for a second imagine that anybody will read this book from cover to cover; it is not
that type of book. Rather, it is the virtue of a handbook that readers can jump immediately
to what they need to know: I want to write a novel (Rogers); teach creative writing in the
community (Sargent); introduce literary theory into my workshops (Ramey); publish
poetry (Twichell; O’Brien); get an agent (Smith; Friedmann; Brodie), choose a degree
(Newman; Vanderslice) and so on. Conversely, if you have no interest in cultural, academic or theoretical contexts you will quickly see that you should avoid Section One, and if
you have no interest in knowing how to get your writing out into the ‘real’ world and make
a splash as a writer, you will turn a blind eye to Section Three (although I gather that this
rather unlikely). But if you were, indeed, to be the ‘ideal reader’ and read the book from
one end to the other, you might make a number of surprising connections.
For instance, Brian Kiteley’s ‘Reading and Writing Historical Fiction’ and David Rain’s
‘Literary Genres’ include digressions into different aspects of the history of the novel, and
might be read in conjunction with Jane Rogers’s ‘Introduction to the Novel’. Aaron
Kunin’s ‘New Poetries’ is packed full of references to experiments with writing and concepts and takes the reader well beyond the realms of poetry. It could be read alongside
Thalia Field’s chapter on ‘Experimental Writing’, after which there would be the surprise
of a different kind of experimental writing to be found in Linda Sargent’s ‘Writing in the
Community’. You certainly might expect to find mention of the experimental French group
of writers known as Oulipo in ‘New Poetries’, but you will also find an Oulipo exercise in
the chapter on historical fiction. Both Alan Brown’s ‘Writing for Children’ and Linda
Newbery’s ‘Writing for Teenagers’ might open your eyes to ways of thinking about writing
which draw on creative processes you might not otherwise encounter, even if you only
intend to write for ‘grown-ups’. The chapter on ‘Writing as “Therapy”’ might be a long way
down the list of chapters to read if your first interest is ‘Form in Poetry’, but in Fiona
Sampson’s piece you will find a section on how text affects audience, spurred on by the poet
John Kinsella, and discussing Keats, Kathleen Jamie, Celan, Pound, Eliot, amongst others,
along the way. In passing you would note that there are some common reference points:
Aristotle’s Poetics recurs time and again; T. S. Eliot’s ‘Tradition and the Individual Talent’
is surprisingly popular, and William Goldman’s dictum, ‘get in late, get out early’ is commandeered by novel, short story and script.
Also remember that many of the contributors are both writers and teachers. All the
pieces have a great enthusiasm. You have only to read Lauri Ramey’s piece on ‘Creative
Writing and Critical Theory’ to know that to be involved in her class would treat you to a
full-on immersion in both criticism and creativity, alongside the broadest of historical
sweeps, and would instil a sense of just how exciting and potent these activities can be for
your own writing. And Gareth Creer’s plea for the teaching of writing as something that is
much, much more than a means of supplementing an income that is always widely variable shows that creative writing teaching, in and out of the academy, can be a necessary
part of the writer’s writing life. You will frequently encounter ideas you will want to introduce into your own practice.
The different approaches offer different models of teaching and reflect the success, or
otherwise, of different kinds of writing within contemporary culture. Lee Gutkind’s chapter
is a replication of teaching ‘creative nonfiction’ via seminars and workshops, as is E. A.
Markham’s chapter on the short story. Sean O’Brien’s ‘Introduction to Poetry’ gives practical advice on the use of a workshop, and what should constitute a good one. Some chapters stand as polemic and some as defences for types of writing regarded as ‘lesser’ in the
context of creative writing (for example, Susan Bassnett’s chapter on ‘Translation’ and also
James Sheard’s ‘Writing for the Web’), or little considered (‘Writing for Radio’ in Mike
Harris’s chapter, and also in Alan Brodie’s ‘The Literary Agent: Television, Radio and
Theatre’). Sean O’Brien’s attack on the dominance of prose over poetry in his essay on
‘Verse Drama’ has a corollary in Susan Bassnett’s note on the 1940s Penguin Classics translations of Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey into prose form rather than a poetic equivalent.
O’Brien’s chapter highlights verse drama’s current near-invisibility and decline and
amounts to a virtual ‘recovery’ of its possibilities and models. Similarly, George Szirtes’
chapter champions other poetic art forms that struggle for a good hearing, the long poem
and the sequence, and Alan Brodie makes a heartfelt plea for Radio Drama as the purest
medium for the scriptwriter.
But a book such as this also gives you the opportunity to think
about trying out writing you might not normally have considered. Judith Barrington’s
chapter on ‘Writing the Memoir’ begins by dispelling the belief that it is a form available
only to ‘the famous’. Any prose writer would benefit from this chapter as it works through
the shaping of narrative. I hope that one of the joys of this book is that, in addition to its
primary functions, it has chapters that will reward those curious about all aspects of literary culture and writing.
2 Introduction
The book also includes insights into areas of writing and writing contexts that will hopefully be new or unusual. For instance, a continuing assumption by some is that the activities of literary criticism and creative writing make unhappy bedfellows within the academy,
with criticism the established forum for literature and creative writing an unwelcome
johnny-come-lately. Lauri Ramey’s chapter here not only demonstrates the shared heritage
for both but the ways in which critical studies from Longinus onwards can be used to engage
with creativity, the role of the writer and writing. Similarly, thinking about ‘genre’ may not
immediately spring to mind as a way in to creativity, but its importance is here shown in
David Rain’s chapter as another feature of contemporary literary culture which has its roots
in the Classical age and which can inform the practice of writing and our reflection upon
it. But genre isn’t just about what we are writing, it is about how we are reading and what
we are expecting when we do pick up a poem or novel, or sit down to watch a film or play.
And, with the history of the novel as a model, Rain shows how new genres and new literature comes into being. Genre is one of the broadest contexts within which a writer can
work, yet the student writer is rarely called upon to explore it unless perhaps asked to define
the difference between ‘literary’ and ‘genre’ fiction (also discussed in Rain’s chapter; and
you will find an exercise to understand genre in Mike Harris’s ‘Introduction to
Scriptwriting’ and discussion of ‘genre’ in ‘Science Fiction and Fantasy’ by Crawford Kilian
and ‘Writing Crime Fiction’ by John Dale). Exploration of genre inevitably takes us into
questions of originality and levels of artistic ambition (also addressed by Lauri Ramey in
the context of literary criticism, and in my chapter on ‘The Role of the Artist’), what kind
of writing ‘enables’ others to write, and what can only be admired as one-off performances.
